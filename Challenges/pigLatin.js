/*
! PIG LATIN CHALLENGE (pair coding) - morning
************
    - Create a function that takes in strings
    - In the function, translate a phrase into pig latin and print it to the console.
    - If able to do so, return the value into another variable and print that variable
    What is Pig Latin?
        * If the word begins with a consonant, remove the consonant to the first vowel, place it at the end of the word, and add an 'ay' to the end (i.e. Pig Latin => IgPay Atinlay)
        * If the word begins with a vowel, simply add an 'ay' at the end of the word
    - It is greatly encouraged to seek out possible solutions utilizing MDN (or anything else that may be helpful).
